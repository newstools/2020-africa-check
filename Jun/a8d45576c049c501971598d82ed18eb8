The latest data on child malnutrition is collected in a global database on child growth and malnutrition, updated regularly by Unicef, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank. The “joint estimates”, as they are known, are calculated from nationally representative household surveys, carried out every three to five years. The current data includes 854 surveys from 152 countries, representing 90% of the world’s children aged under five. South Africa’s numbers are from the 2016 South African Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). We took a look at four key measures of malnutrition: wasting, stunting, underweight and overweight.
